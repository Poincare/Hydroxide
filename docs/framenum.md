#FrameNum

The number of frames elapsed is sometimes quite important in game programming, since depending on the parity of frames, you may want to change something on screen.

Hydroxide keeps tracks of frames elapsed for you, you can use:

```javascript
Hydroxide.getFrameNum();
```

to get the number of frames elapsed.
