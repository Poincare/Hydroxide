#Hydroxide - HTML5 Canvas Game Engine
---

##Why is it cool?

Its small, easy-to-use and keeps you free to do whatever the heck you want.
The source code is extremely well documented and easy to understand.

Check out examples/ and docs/ to learn more.

The examples/clickr/ is currently the most full featured example, but, docs/ will get you started much faster.

**jQuery is a dependency!**

##Features

* Object-based everything-  you link in objects into the engine
* Event based - the engine fire events that your objects can catch
* Collision detection - Detect when a collision occurs, and get an event fired
* State machine - read and write states of the engine
* Keyboard and Mouse input - calls functions in your objects
* Global data - Tie in data objects into Hydroxide, and they're there in all your objects
* Simple - Stays out of your way, but, abstracts away some things

##TODO

* Fix the identation! Its off in so many files! This will also get you accuainted with the source code :)

* Write a game. The only way we'll find issues is if people use Hydroxide.

* Tell your friends (i.e. watch the project). Refer to point two to find out why.
