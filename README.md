#Hydroxide - HTML5 Canvas Game Engine
---

##Why is it awesome?

Hydroxide is a **threaded**, simple and out-of-your-way game framework for the HTML5 Canvas.

Its small, easy-to-use and keeps you free to do whatever the heck you want.

The source code is extremely well documented and easy to understand.

Check out examples/ and docs/ to learn more.

The examples/clickr/ is currently the most full featured example, but, docs/ will get you started much faster.

**jQuery is a dependency!** 

##Features

* Awesome docs - We document a ton and comment everything else
* Object-based everything -  you link in objects into the engine
* Event based - the engine fire events that your objects can catch
* Collision detection - Detect when a collision occurs, and get an event fired
* State machine - read and write states of the engine
* Keyboard and Mouse input - calls functions in your objects
* Global data - Tie in data objects into Hydroxide, and they're there in all your objects
* Base objects - Use prebuilt objects that include some commonly used methods that speed up development!
* Simple - Stays out of your way, but, abstracts away some things

##TODO

* Fix the indentation! Its off in so many files! This will also get you accuainted with the source code :)

* Write a game/demo. The only way we'll find issues is if people use Hydroxide.

* Tell your friends (i.e. watch the project). Refer to the point above to find out why.

And, best of all, send pull requests!
